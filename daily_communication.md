## Introduction

> Tell me about yourself.

## Answer

Hi, I’m [Your Name]. I have around three years of experience working in product and business analytics.

In my current role, I work closely with sales and operations teams, mainly on Microsoft Dynamics and Power BI. My work involves maintaining and enhancing the CRM platform, building dashboards using Dataverse data, and tracking the full sales funnel—from leads to opportunities to closed deals.

A key part of my role is ensuring data accuracy and turning complex workflows into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders. I regularly work on funnel metrics, conversion rates, sales performance, and revenue tracking, and I support leadership with data for decision-making.

Overall, I enjoy roles where I can combine data problem-solving with business understanding and stakeholder collaboration.”

## Question-1

> Can you briefly describe a recent project you worked on and explain your role in it

## Answer - 1

> While I haven’t worked on major standalone projects recently, my primary work involves maintaining and enhancing the Microsoft Dynamics platform based on client needs. I also develop Power BI dashboards using Dataverse data. My key role is to manage the sales funnel—tracking how leads convert into opportunities and ultimately sales—and I present these insights to stakeholders via dashboards.”

## Question - 2

> Tell me about a challenge you faced at work and how you handled it.

## Answer - 2

### Simple Answer

> Recently, a client noticed inconsistencies between multiple dashboards. I investigated by thoroughly checking them and discovered discrepancies in the source data—some values were missing or incorrect. I corrected the data at its source, revalidated all dashboards, and ensured alignment. In the end, the client was very satisfied with the resolution.

### Better Answer

> In a recent project, our sales forecast model wasn’t aligning with actual revenue trends. As a senior analyst with three years of experience, I identified that our model wasn’t accounting for seasonality in a key product segment. I collaborated with the product and marketing teams to incorporate seasonal promotional data. After revising the model, we improved forecast accuracy by 15%, allowing leadership to make better inventory decisions. This showed both my problem-solving and business understanding, as we directly impacted profitability.

## Question - 3

> How do you decide which metrics to track when building a dashboard for business stakeholders?”

## Answer - 3

> When deciding on metrics, I focus on what stakeholders truly rely on. In my current role, I manage the sales funnel, so the primary areas are leads, opportunities, and sales. Stakeholders are most interested in revenue and the performance of their teams. Thus, I track total leads, opportunities, closed deals, average contract value, and conversion rates. Additionally, I break down leads and closed deals per representative and benchmark them against targets. I also track average time to close. These ensure we align the dashboard with business outcomes and team performance.

## Question - 4

> Tell me about a time when a stakeholder disagreed with your analysis. How did you handle it?”

## Answer - 4

> I had a situation when I noticed the disqualified leads were unusually high, the stakeholder challenged it. I worked with them to investigate and discovered that when lead ownership was recently reassigned, the “modified” date changed, distorting the count. To resolve it, I created a new column that reflected the original disqualification date from audit history. Once we used that, the figures aligned with reality. This approach showed the stakeholder that I take their concerns seriously, and we ended up with a more accurate dashboard.

## Question - 5

> Question: Tell me about a time when you failed.

**Situation**

“Earlier in my role, I was responsible for delivering a sales performance dashboard to stakeholders on a tight timeline.”

**Task**

“My goal was to provide quick visibility into lead-to-sale conversion so leadership could review performance before a monthly meeting.”

**Action**

“To meet the deadline, I prioritized speed and reused existing logic from an older dashboard. However, I didn’t spend enough time validating edge cases in the source data, especially around recently updated records.”

**Result**

“After release, stakeholders noticed some numbers didn’t fully align with their expectations. While the issue wasn’t business-critical, it reduced confidence in the dashboard initially. I took ownership, revalidated the data, corrected the logic, and communicated transparently about the fix.”

**Learning / Improvement (very important)**

“Since then, I’ve built a habit of adding a structured QC checklist before delivery—especially for date logic and status changes. This has significantly reduced post-release issues and improved stakeholder trust.”
