## 1️⃣ First 15 Seconds: Take Control

**Always start like this:**

> “Let me restate the problem to ensure alignment…”

Then restate using:

- Metric change
- Direction (+/–)
- Timeframe
- Segment
- Any known change

📌 _This buys you thinking time and shows clarity._

---

## 2️⃣ Identify the Metric Type (Critical Fork)

Ask yourself silently:

**Is this metric about…**

### A. Growth / Usage?

→ DAU, MAU, sessions, traffic
**Think:** acquisition, engagement

### B. Conversion?

→ Checkout, signup, activation
**Think:** funnel, UX, friction

### C. Revenue?

→ Subscription, GMV, ARPU
**Think:** pricing, retention, mix

👉 This decides **everything that follows**.

---

## 3️⃣ Decompose the Metric (Say This Explicitly)

Use **one clean equation**:

### Growth

DAU = New Users + Retained Users

### Conversion

Conversion = Step 1 → Step 2 → … → Completion

### Revenue (Subscription)

Revenue = Active Users × Conversion × ARPU × Retention

📌 Say:

> “I’ll break this metric into its downstream drivers…”

---

## 4️⃣ Funnel First, Always

If:

- Traffic flat → **mid / lower funnel**
- DAU flat → **monetization / retention**
- New users impacted → **UX / onboarding**
- Existing users impacted → **pricing / habit / trust**

📌 Never skip funnel thinking.

---

## 5️⃣ Generate Hypotheses Using Buckets (Not Creativity)

### For UX / Conversion Issues

**Only 4 buckets:**

1. **Effort** – more steps, more fields, forced login
2. **Clarity** – confusing CTAs, hidden options, unclear flow
3. **Trust** – payment security, refunds, delivery info
4. **Reliability** – crashes, slow load, payment failures

👉 Pick **2–3**, not 10.

---

### For Revenue Issues

**Only 4 levers:**

1. Pricing changes
2. Plan mix shifts
3. Renewal / churn changes
4. Proration / timing effects

---

## 6️⃣ The Most Important Sentence Pattern ⭐

Memorize this **verbatim**:

> “To validate this hypothesis, I would **_, and if confirmed, the implication would be _**.”

This turns:

- Thinking → Action
- Analysis → Decision

📌 If you miss this, the answer feels incomplete.

---

## 7️⃣ Prioritization Rule (When Asked “Why First?”)

Say one of these:

- “Because it aligns with the timing of the change”
- “Because it impacts the largest portion of users”
- “Because it’s the highest-risk funnel step”
- “Because it’s most reversible”

Never say:
❌ “I’d check everything”

---

## 8️⃣ Handle Interruptions Calmly

Use this **4-step pattern**:

1. “That’s a fair point.”
2. Anchor to known facts
3. Explain your prioritization
4. Show flexibility

📌 Never get defensive. Never rush.

---

## 9️⃣ End with a Decision-Oriented Close

Always end with:

> “The goal is to isolate the root cause and recommend whether to roll back, iterate, or scale the change.”

This signals **business thinking**, not just analytics.

---

## 10️⃣ 10-Second Internal Checklist (Before You Speak)

Ask yourself:

- Did I restate?
- Did I decompose?
- Did I prioritize?
- Did I say how I’d validate?
- Did I mention what action follows?

If yes → you’re doing great.

---

## Final Truth (Important)

You don’t need:
❌ fancy words
❌ perfect metrics
❌ SQL in interviews

You need:
✅ structure
✅ calm delivery
✅ clear decision flow
