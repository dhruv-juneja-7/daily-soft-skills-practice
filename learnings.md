Add to cart

View cart

Start checkout

Typical metrics:

## 1️⃣ First 15 Seconds: Take Control

**Always start like this:**

> “Let me restate the problem to ensure alignment…”

Then restate using:

- Metric change
- Direction (+/–)
- Timeframe
- Segment
- Any known change

📌 _This buys you thinking time and shows clarity._

---

## 2️⃣ Identify the Metric Type (Critical Fork)

Ask yourself silently:

**Is this metric about…**

### A. Growth / Usage?

→ DAU, MAU, sessions, traffic
**Think:** acquisition, engagement

### B. Conversion?

→ Checkout, signup, activation
**Think:** funnel, UX, friction

### C. Revenue?

→ Subscription, GMV, ARPU
**Think:** pricing, retention, mix

👉 This decides **everything that follows**.

---

## 3️⃣ Decompose the Metric (Say This Explicitly)

Use **one clean equation**:

### Growth

DAU = New Users + Retained Users

### Conversion

Conversion = Step 1 → Step 2 → … → Completion

### Revenue (Subscription)

Revenue = Active Users × Conversion × ARPU × Retention

📌 Say:

> “I’ll break this metric into its downstream drivers…”

---

## 4️⃣ Funnel First, Always

If:

- Traffic flat → **mid / lower funnel**
- DAU flat → **monetization / retention**
- New users impacted → **UX / onboarding**
- Existing users impacted → **pricing / habit / trust**

📌 Never skip funnel thinking.

---

## 5️⃣ Generate Hypotheses Using Buckets (Not Creativity)

### For UX / Conversion Issues

**Only 4 buckets:**

1. **Effort** – more steps, more fields, forced login
2. **Clarity** – confusing CTAs, hidden options, unclear flow
3. **Trust** – payment security, refunds, delivery info
4. **Reliability** – crashes, slow load, payment failures

👉 Pick **2–3**, not 10.

---

### For Revenue Issues

**Only 4 levers:**

1. Pricing changes
2. Plan mix shifts
3. Renewal / churn changes
4. Proration / timing effects

---

## 6️⃣ The Most Important Sentence Pattern ⭐

Memorize this **verbatim**:

> “To validate this hypothesis, I would **_, and if confirmed, the implication would be _**.”

This turns:

- Thinking → Action
- Analysis → Decision

📌 If you miss this, the answer feels incomplete.

---

## 7️⃣ Prioritization Rule (When Asked “Why First?”)

Say one of these:

- “Because it aligns with the timing of the change”
- “Because it impacts the largest portion of users”
- “Because it’s the highest-risk funnel step”
- “Because it’s most reversible”

Never say:
❌ “I’d check everything”

---

## 8️⃣ Handle Interruptions Calmly

Use this **4-step pattern**:

1. “That’s a fair point.”
2. Anchor to known facts
3. Explain your prioritization
4. Show flexibility

📌 Never get defensive. Never rush.

---

## 9️⃣ End with a Decision-Oriented Close

Always end with:

> “The goal is to isolate the root cause and recommend whether to roll back, iterate, or scale the change.”

This signals **business thinking**, not just analytics.

---

## 10️⃣ 10-Second Internal Checklist (Before You Speak)

Ask yourself:

- Did I restate?
- Did I decompose?
- Did I prioritize?
- Did I say how I’d validate?
- Did I mention what action follows?

If yes → you’re doing great.

---

## Final Truth (Important)

You don’t need:
❌ fancy words
❌ perfect metrics
❌ SQL in interviews

You need:
✅ structure
✅ calm delivery
✅ clear decision flow

# How to decide metrics?

## Why defining metrics feels hard

Most people think:

> “I need to come up with the _right_ metrics.”

What actually works:

> **Metrics fall out _after_ you lock the goal + funnel stage.**

Right now, you’re jumping straight from **problem → metrics**, skipping 2 steps.

---

## The 3-step trick that unlocks metrics 🔓

Whenever you’re stuck, do this **in order**:

### 1️⃣ Say the goal in ONE LINE

Not “business growth”. Be concrete.

Examples:

- “Increase first-time investment”
- “Improve retention after month 1”
- “Reduce drop-offs post-KYC”

If you can’t say this, metrics will feel impossible.

---

### 2️⃣ Name the ONE user action that proves success

This is the magic step.

Ask yourself:

> “What did the user _do_ if we succeeded?”

Examples:

- Made first investment
- Added funds again
- Completed KYC
- Increased AUM

That action = **primary metric**.

---

### 3️⃣ Only now define supporting metrics

Use this **always-safe template**:

- **Rate** → how many users do it?
- **Time** → how long does it take?
- **Depth** → how much / how often?

That’s it. That’s the formula.

---

## Apply this to your Dezerv case (live example)

### Problem:

Signups ↑, KYC stable, first investments flat

### Step 1: Goal

> Increase first-time investments

### Step 2: Success action

> User makes their first investment

### Step 3: Metrics (using the template)

#### ✅ Primary metric

- % of KYC-completed users who make first investment

#### ✅ Supporting metrics

**Rate**

- Conversion from KYC → first investment
- Conversion by acquisition channel

**Time**

- Median time from KYC → first investment
- % users investing within 7 / 30 days

**Depth**

- Average first investment amount

Boom.
You didn’t “invent” metrics — you _derived_ them.

---

## A cheat-sheet you can memorise (seriously)

When stuck, say this sentence:

> “I’d define one primary success metric tied to the user’s core action, and then supporting metrics around rate, time, and depth.”

Interviewers LOVE this sentence.

---

## Why this works in interviews

- You don’t sound random
- You don’t overshoot
- You sound calm and methodical
- Even if metrics aren’t perfect, your _thinking is_

They are **evaluating the process**, not the exact metric names.

---

## One last mindset shift (important)

You are not expected to:
❌ Define all metrics
❌ Know company dashboards
❌ Be exhaustive

You ARE expected to:
✅ Pick reasonable metrics
✅ Explain _why_
✅ Adjust if challenged

That’s it.

---

## Let’s lock this in with a 30-second drill

I’ll give you a tiny prompt. You answer **only metrics**, nothing else.

**Prompt:**

> “Users are completing KYC but not setting up SIPs.”

Reply with:

- Goal
- Primary metric
- 2–3 supporting metrics

No overthinking. Just apply the template.

# How to decide hypotheses?

## The “4-Bucket Hypothesis Framework” (memorise this)

Whenever something goes wrong (drop, plateau, spike), **force all hypotheses into these buckets**:

### 1️⃣ **WHO** – User quality / intent

> “Are we getting the right users?”

Examples:

- Low-intent users from new channels
- First-time investors are hesitant
- Users just exploring, not ready to act

---

### 2️⃣ **WHAT** – Product / experience friction

> “Is something in the flow stopping them?”

Examples:

- Too many steps post-KYC
- Confusing fund selection
- Minimum investment too high
- Trust or security concerns

---

### 3️⃣ **WHY PAY** – Pricing / value perception

> “Do users feel it’s worth it?”

Examples:

- Fees unclear or feel high
- Value vs competitors not obvious
- Incentives removed or weaker

---

### 4️⃣ **WHEN / OUTSIDE** – Timing & external factors

> “Is this about context, not product?”

Examples:

- Market downturn
- Seasonal behavior
- Users delaying decisions

---

## Why this framework is powerful

- You **never blank out**
- You sound **structured, not scattered**
- You don’t jump to solutions
- Interviewers recognise this instantly

Even if your hypotheses aren’t perfect, your **thinking is**.

---

## How to apply it in an interview (exact phrasing)

Say this sentence (it’s gold):

> “I’d bucket my hypotheses into user intent, product friction, pricing perception, and external factors.”

Then list **1–2 hypotheses per bucket**.
That’s all. Don’t overshoot.

---

## Apply this to YOUR Dezerv case (clean version)

### Problem:

KYC stable, first investment flat

### Hypotheses:

#### 1️⃣ User intent

- New acquisition channels bring lower-intent users
- First-time investors need more reassurance

#### 2️⃣ Product friction

- Drop-offs at fund selection or bank linking
- Minimum investment amount creates hesitation

#### 3️⃣ Pricing / value

- Fees perceived as high at investment step
- Value proposition not clear vs alternatives

#### 4️⃣ External

- Market volatility delaying investment decisions

This is **textbook good**.

---

## How to test hypotheses (1-liner rule)

If asked “how would you test this?”:

- WHO → segment by channel / cohort
- WHAT → step-level funnel analysis
- WHY PAY → drop-offs at fee exposure
- WHEN → trend vs time / market data
